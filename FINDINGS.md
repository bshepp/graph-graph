# Findings: Emergent Dimension from Local Graph Rules

A running record of what the emergence experiments have actually shown.
Theory and framing live in [DIMENSIONAL_COHERENCE.md](DIMENSIONAL_COHERENCE.md);
this file is the empirical log. All results are reproducible with the seeds
shown via `dimension.py`, `track_dimension.py`, and the rules in `rules.py`.

## The instrument

Before measuring emergence we had to trust the ruler. The local effective
dimension estimator (`dimension.py`) was rebuilt to:

- use a **finite-size-corrected** log-log fit (`log|B| = d·log r + c + a/r`),
  which recovers known dimensions to within ~0.05 (a plain fit reads ~0.4
  low and would mis-bin 3D as 2D);
- **gate on regime existence** -- it returns *undefined* (nan) unless there
  are enough unsaturated radii (ball kept under ~10% of the graph) and the
  power-law fit is clean. Small-world / expander graphs have no polynomial
  ball-growth regime, so their dimension is genuinely undefined, not a
  fabricated number.

Validated against graphs of known dimension: `python dimension.py --validate`
(1D/2D/3D recovery, backend agreement, and undefined-on-expander all pass).

The key derived signal is **`defined_frac`**: the fraction of nodes that have
a well-defined effective dimension. On a geometric graph it is ~1; on an
expander it is ~0. Its change over time (via `track_dimension.py`) is the
preservation / emergence signal.

## What changes dimension, and what doesn't

| Rule | Mechanism (local only) | Result | Why |
|------|------------------------|--------|-----|
| `majority`, `activation`, `reinforcement` | update state / weights, not topology | dimension invariant | topology unchanged |
| `rewire` | rewire edges to **random** targets | **destroys** structure (lattice d≈2 → undefined in ~30 steps) | adds long-range shortcuts → collapses diameter |
| `prune` | remove low-overlap "shortcut" edges | small-world → **d≈1** (`defined_frac` 0→100%) | strips shortcuts → diameter grows → latent ring revealed |
| `triadic` | rewire edges to friends-of-friends | clustering 0.002 → 0.625 but **dimension stays undefined** | clustering rises, diameter stays short |
| `grown` (generator) | degree-capped frontier growth | **tunable emergent d**: cap 6→2.1, 7→2.7, 8→2.9 | cap forces outward growth → large diameter |

**Unifying insight:** the active ingredient for emergent dimension is
**extent (large diameter)**, not local density. `prune` and `triadic` succeed
/ fail for the *same* reason -- one grows the diameter, the other doesn't.
`grown` makes it cleanest: bound the degree, force growth to the frontier,
and dimension falls out, tunable by one local scalar.

### A spectrum of "emergence"

- `prune` is **weak emergence**: d≈1 was *latent* in the Watts-Strogatz
  construction (ring + shortcuts); pruning revealed it.
- `triadic` is an **honest negative**: proves clustering ≠ geometry.
- `grown` is **strong emergence**: dimension that was never latent (grown
  from a triangle), from a simple local rule, tunable by the degree cap.
  Caveat: the cap *selects* d, so it is "emergence with a knob," not a
  spontaneously preferred dimension.

## The attractor question: is there a *preferred* dimension?

The strongest version of the hypothesis: a local rule whose emergent
dimension is reached from **any** initial condition (selected by the
dynamics, not inherited or set by a knob).

Tested with `geometrize` -- homeostatic local rewiring toward a target
degree (shed the most shortcut-like edge when over-connected, add a triadic
edge when under-connected): the two ingredients that make dimension, run as
a feedback loop.

**Result: no global attractor. The dynamics are bistable.**

| Initial graph | Under `geometrize(target=6)` |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| 2D lattice (d≈2) | **stable fixed point** -- stays d≈2, stays connected (recovers after a dip) |
| random, scale-free (undefined) | **stuck at `defined_frac` ≈ 0** -- never geometrizes |
| small-world | geometrizes (has a latent ring) but d **drifts**, doesn't settle |
| `grown` (cap 10) | **fragments** (largest component 100% → ~13%) |

`target_degree` does not cleanly tune the stable dimension either (on a
lattice: 4→2.0, 6→2.2, 8→ mostly destroyed). So `geometrize` *preserves*
geometry within its basin but neither nucleates nor tunes it.

### The bootstrapping barrier

The reason random / scale-free graphs cannot be geometrized is sharp:

> "Local" attachment (friend-of-friend) is only meaningful once locality
> already exists. In a zero-clustering expander a node's 2-hop neighborhood
> is a *random* part of the graph, so "rewire locally" = "rewire randomly."
> There is no seed of geometry to amplify.

This is why `prune` worked on small-world (latent ring = seed) and `grown`
worked (built geometrically, never passing through an expander), but
`geometrize` cannot geometrize a random graph. **The expander/dimensionless
state is itself a stable phase that local rewiring cannot escape.**

### Curvature flow hits the same barrier

The strongest principled candidate for nucleating geometry is a discrete
**Forman-Ricci curvature flow** (`ricci`): rewire negative-curvature
shortcuts toward triangle-closing (positive-curvature) positions, so
curvature only ever increases. Run on a random graph:

| step | defined | clustering | mean Forman curvature | eccentricity |
|------|---------|------------|------------------------|--------------|
| 0    | 0%      | 0.003      | -9.8                   | 6            |
| 80   | 0%      | 0.42       | -6.7                   | 7            |
| 480  | 0%      | 0.43       | -6.6                   | 8            |

It raises clustering and curvature but **plateaus at a clumped, negatively
curved, short-diameter fixed point** -- the eccentricity never grows, so
dimension never appears. The flat eccentricity is the key: local rewiring
builds clustering by *crumpling*, not by *unfolding* into extent.

### Interpretation

Three distinct local rewiring mechanisms -- `triadic` (clustering),
`geometrize` (degree homeostasis), and `ricci` (curvature flow) -- **all**
fail to nucleate geometry from a random graph, and all reach the same
clumped small-world fixed point. The obstruction is mechanism-independent:

> **Local rewiring cannot grow *extent* (diameter) from an expander.** It can
> create local triangles, but those crumple into the existing short-diameter
> structure instead of unfolding into an extended manifold. Growing the
> diameter would require removing shortcuts faster than the graph
> re-localizes, which either fragments it or stalls.

So, under fixed-N local rules: **dimension is bistable, not attracting.
Geometry must be *seeded* -- grown outward (the `grown` generator, which
never passes through an expander) or already latent (a small-world ring) --
it does not spontaneously condense from maximal disorder.** This maps onto
the "dimensionally incoherent" phase in DIMENSIONAL_COHERENCE.md (the
dark-matter analog): a stable, non-geometric phase that local dynamics
cannot escape.

**Scope:** strong, mechanism-independent evidence across four local rewiring
rules plus a growth generator -- not a formal proof. An Ollivier-Ricci flow
(optimal-transport curvature) is the one untested variant, but the obstruction
observed is about *extent*, not the curvature measure, so the same barrier is
expected. The clean way to *get* a chosen dimension remains the `grown`
generator (build it geometrically; the degree cap tunes d).

## Open threads

- **Curvature flow** vs the bootstrapping barrier: tested (`ricci`) -- hits
  the same barrier (above). Ollivier-Ricci (optimal-transport) is the one
  untested variant but is expected to behave the same (the obstruction is
  extent, not the curvature measure).
- **Spatial coherence:** Moran's I on the `d_eff` field, to confirm emergent
  structure forms coherent phases rather than scattered noise.
- **Robustness / scale:** does `grown`'s cap→dimension law hold across N and
  seeds, and at the 100K+ scale the theory says emergence may require?
- **Preservation of emergent structure:** do the dynamic rules preserve or
  erode a `grown` graph's dimension (as they do for the lattice)?
